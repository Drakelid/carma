# Unlock Efficient, Green Last‑Mile Delivery — Powered by Your Daily Commute

### Our crowdsourced platform matches local senders with drivers already on the road, cutting delivery costs by up to **30 %** and CO₂ emissions at the same time.

## Problem

- Small businesses, farmers and online sellers face high last-mile logistics costs that erode margins and limit growth.  
- Meanwhile, thousands of commuters drive with empty boot space every day—untapped capacity ready to be monetised.

---

## Solution

- A mobile‑ and web‑based marketplace that lets senders post deliveries and instantly match them with vetted drivers travelling the same route.  
- Same‑day or next‑day service at **20‑30 %** below traditional courier rates, with real‑time tracking and proof of delivery.

---

## Market Opportunity

- **Pilot region: Vestland, Norway** — high rural‑urban traffic and dense SME cluster.  
- Industry surveys indicate **90 %** of retailers expect to adopt crowdsourced delivery by **2028**.  
- Platform is readily scalable across Norway and the wider Nordic markets.

---

## Business Model

- **Commission**: ~20 % of each delivery; drivers keep ~80 %.  
- Distance‑based dynamic pricing; membership discounts for frequent senders.  
- Future revenue streams: premium rush service, higher insurance tiers, in‑app promotions.

---

## Traction & Pilot Highlights

- MVP complete; pilot launching with **20–30 drivers** and anchor businesses (bakery, florist, farm co‑op).  
- KPI targets: break‑even in pilot region by **Q4 2026**; CO₂ savings tracked per delivery.

---

## Competitive Edge

- Leverages **pre‑planned trips** (unlike food‑delivery gig apps that create extra traffic).  
- Regional density first, then scale.  
- Built‑in insurance, BankID verification and EV bonuses to win trust.

---

## Technology

- Cross‑platform driver app (Flutter/React Native) and web dashboard.  
- Geo‑matching algorithms, Stripe/Vipps payments, PostGIS geodata, GDPR‑compliant EU cloud.

---

## Environmental Impact

- Consolidating packages into existing trips lowers congestion and emissions; default EV incentives.  
- **Live CO₂ counter** shows cumulative tonnes saved—aligning with Norway’s green‑transport goals.

---

## Legal & Risk Mitigation

- Tax withholding for casual drivers; option for sole‑proprietor invoicing.  
- Mandatory vehicle insurance plus platform group accident & goods‑in‑transit cover (up to 5 000 NOK).  
- Criminal‑record and licence checks; GDPR‑ready data security.
